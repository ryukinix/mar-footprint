## Abstract

This project is about a special standalone of MAR whose try get a footprint of each program memory debug. The implementation is based on the core of [`mar`](https://gitlab.com/ryukinix/mar) as the lib to handle all the information.

## Getting Start

```
# deps, python package manager
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
sudo pip3 install setuptools
# project
sudo pip3 install git+https://gitlab.com/ryukinix/mar-footprint
```

## Command Line Interface
```
usage: footprint [-h] [-t TARGET] [-i INTERVAL] [--show-graph] [--save-graph]
                 csvs [csvs ...]

Read malloc-free pairs CSVs from debugmalloc program,do a sequence of stats
processing to processing data.On the final of processing, get a summarization
and put on new CSV.Beyond that, the user can choice by CLI to save or show
graphs. v0.5.2 Developed by Manoel Vilela on Federal University of Par√° as
Student Researcher at 2016

positional arguments:
  csvs                  The list of pair malloc_0x.csv free_0x separated by
                        spaces or a dir

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -t TARGET, --target TARGET
                        The path (can be a folder name or path) to save the
                        output
  -i INTERVAL, --interval INTERVAL
                        The interval number to count longs on streaking rows
  --show-graph          Show the graph after pre-processing
  --save-graph          Save the graph on target after pre-processing
